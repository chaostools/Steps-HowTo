 <B>Steps to debug an app:</B>
  - create your app. add a break point by clicking on the line number.(avoid adding break points on empty lines/ function names)
  - `Run` -> `Debug`
  - app will start. your debugger will popup when your code at the break point is executed.  
        step into: go inside the function/class. dont use it to many times or you will reach stupid backend like string.class ,etc
        setp out: go back to previous class  
        step over: skip going inside, run inside class's codes and get result
  - you may have completely executed the function if you somehow land into view.java
  - to re run debugger while app is running on phn,press the green button coming by side.
